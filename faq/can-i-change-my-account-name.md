## Can I change my account name ?
There is no central entity in the blockchain , we don't have any authority over your accounts key or assets. Therefore there is no way to delete a blockchain account or change the name of it. If you are not happy with your accounts name its totally okay to get yourself a second account from [here](https://d.tube/newaccount)
